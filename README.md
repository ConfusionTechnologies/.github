# .github

This is a special repository that can control some organization-level things. For example:

- The contents of the organization's profile page, see [`profile/README.md`](profile/README.md).
- Default community health files, i.e. Code of Conduct, Contribution Guide, Vulnerability Reporting Guide, etc.
- Default issue & pull request templates.

Read more at: <https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file>.

This repository is also likely a good place to put organization-level public documentation. See <https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile#adding-a-member-only-organization-profile-readme> for where to put organization-level private documentation.

## TODO

- Create public-facing profile (profile picture, tagline, description).
- Table of contents for all repositories (excluding testing forks) to enable navigation at a glance.
